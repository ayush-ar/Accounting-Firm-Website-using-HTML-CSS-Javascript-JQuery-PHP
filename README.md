# Accounting-Firm-Website-using-HTML-CSS-Javascript-JQuery-PHP
Accounting Firm website made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and PHP.

In this project of building an Accounting Firm website i've used HTML and CSS as base languages and a bit of Javascript for Google maps API integration, little bit of JQuery in navigation bar of my website and a bit of PHP to submit the form on my website.
